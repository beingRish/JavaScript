    <h3>WildCard MetaCharacter</h3>
    <p>The wild card is represented by a period(.).</p>
    <p>Wild card means it can be anything. So when a period is used in a regular expression, it represents any single character.</p>
    <p>But it has exceptions with some control characters like New Line.</p>
